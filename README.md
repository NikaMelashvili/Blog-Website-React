# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

In this project, I am utilizing a third-party API to retrieve and display posts. Additionally, I am implementing functionality to create and publish blog posts. Furthermore, I am incorporating various API filters to sort the displayed content based on different criteria. This project serves as an excellent showcase of how I work with APIs.
